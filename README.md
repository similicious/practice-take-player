# ðŸŽ¤ practice-taker-player

This svelte app is a multi track audio player for choir practice takes.

The vision is to allow the user to select a song from a library of practice takes. The song can then be played back and the user can adjust volume levels, panning, muting etc. Oh and the goal is also to learn Svelte ðŸŽ‰
